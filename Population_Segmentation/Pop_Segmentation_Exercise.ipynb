    "# Population Segmentation with SageMaker\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you'll employ two, unsupervised learning algorithms to do **population segmentation**. Population segmentation aims to find natural groupings in population data that reveal some feature-level similarities between different regions in the US.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using **principal component analysis** (PCA) you will reduce the dimensionality of the original census data. Then, you'll use **k-means clustering** to assign each US county to a particular cluster based on where a county lies in component space. How each cluster is arranged in component space can tell you which US counties are most similar and what demographic traits define that similarity; this information is most often used to inform targeted, marketing campaigns that want to appeal to a specific group of people. This cluster information is also useful for learning more about a population by revealing patterns between regions that you otherwise may not have noticed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### US Census Data\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll be using data collected by the [US Census](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Census), which aims to count the US population, recording demographic traits about labor, age, population, and so on, for each county in the US. The bulk of this notebook was taken from an existing SageMaker example notebook and [blog post](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/analyze-us-census-data-for-population-segmentation-using-amazon-sagemaker/), and I've broken it down further into demonstrations and exercises for you to complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Machine Learning Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "To implement population segmentation, you'll go through a number of steps:\n",
    "* Data loading and exploration\n",
    "* Data cleaning and pre-processing \n",
    "* Dimensionality reduction with PCA\n",
    "* Feature engineering and data transformation\n",
    "* Clustering transformed data with k-means\n",
    "* Extracting trained model attributes and visualizing k clusters\n",
    "\n",
    "These tasks make up a complete, machine learning workflow from data loading and cleaning to model deployment. Each exercise is designed to give you practice with part of the machine learning workflow, and to demonstrate how to use SageMaker tools, such as built-in data management with S3 and built-in algorithms.\n",

For higher dimensions, an algorithm like k-means has a difficult time figuring out which features are most important, and the result is, often, noisier clusters.\n",

To decide how many top components to include, it's helpful to look at how much **data variance** the components capture.

    "You have just walked through a machine learning workflow for unsupervised learning, specifically, for clustering a dataset using k-means after reducing the dimensionality using PCA. By accessing the underlying models created within  SageMaker, you were able to improve the explainability of your model and draw insights from the resultant clusters. \n",
